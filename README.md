# Huckleberry Agency Website

In this first workshop of mine, I am going to build a minimal landing page for an agency, a fictional consultancy.

It's based on the mockups provided by Josh (see [Josh's README file](READMEofJoshs.md)).

I am going to use **FLOW LAYOUT**:

* no flexbox
* no grid
* no absolute positioning

The project relies heavily on:

* padding
* margin
* border

At the moment I am working on it ... ðŸš§

1. **forked** > my github repo created
2. **cloned** > all the files downloaded onto my machine

```
npm clone git@github.com:jtrfs/huckleberry.git
```
