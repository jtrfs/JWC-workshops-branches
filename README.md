# About the workshops | MAIN BRANCH

#### Josh says:

> _Workshops are **real-world-inspired problems**. The project and its goals are described in depth in the project's¬†README¬†file, though you'll be given the gist of the project here in the course materials. You might not be able to solve the workshop, and that's OK.¬†Some workshops are super challenging. **It's about the journey, not the destination**._

#### Here's the recommended path:

1. If you get stuck or don't know how to proceed, you can **review the lessons** in this module.
2. Spend up to **2 hours working on the problem**. If you get discouraged or frustrated, you can stop earlier!
3. After you've invested a good chunk of time into the problem, **watch the solution video** (embedded in the next lesson). I'll show you how I'd approach this problem.

> _Note that there are **many valid solutions** for most workshops; your solution might look quite different than mine, but that doesn't mean you did it wrong! As we went over in the onboarding video, though, you don't have to follow this approach! If you'd prefer, you can code along with the video. Or you can bounce between coding and watching the solution.¬†This **course is for you**._

> _Once you're finished with the workshop (regardless of whether you've completed the exercises or not), you can **submit the link** to your solution. This is mainly to serve as an accountability tool. On occasion, I'll go through the submissions to see broadly where people are struggling, but **I don't offer individual reviews**._

### Structure of my repo/workflow

`(practising git skills)`

I am quite struggling to make it work ... üßê. But I have probably succeeded üòé.

1. One repository, created locally and then remotely through gh cli (just to try it). The idea is to have only one repo and then several different branches, each for individual workshops.
2. On themain branch I am creating the md file and that's it.
3. Creating a new local branch out of main branch ... rewriting the readme file.
4. Getting just the zip file and dropping it in the folder/new branch space. Cloning makes it a mess. Not sure if it is possible like that.
5. Setting the new/my remote branch for pushing and pulling. I think git push -u origin newBranch is necessary for it to work.
6. Working on the task. Don't forget about git add, git commit, git push before leaving branches. Everything must by committed.
