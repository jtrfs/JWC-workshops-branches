# Huckleberry Agency Website

In this first workshop of mine, I am going to build a minimal landing page for an agency, a fictional consultancy.

It's based on the mockups provided by Josh (see [Josh's README file](READMEofJoshs.md)).

I am going to use **FLOW LAYOUT**:

* no flexbox
* no grid
* no absolute positioning

The project relies heavily on:

* padding
* margin
* border

---

At the moment I am done 👍🏻

1. **workshop branch created** > my github repo is waiting for changes/pushes
2. **folders and files activated** > all the files downloaded/unzipped in the right place/branch

```
git add -A
git commit -m "message"
git push
```
