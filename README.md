# Character Creator

In this workshop, I am asked to build a character creator for a Sims-style video game.

It follows the mockups provided by Josh (see [Josh's README file](READMEofJoshs.md)).

This project is built with **REACT** and uses **CSS Modules**.. CSS modules are ultimately very similar to vanilla CSS, but the classes are applied in JS. Additionally, a few global styles can be found in src/index.css.

## Exercises:

#### Exercise 1: Fix footer links

#### Exercise 2: Layout adjustments

#### Exercise 3: Overflow

#### Exercise 4: Perspective decoration

#### Exercise 5 (Stretch): Implement a mobile variant
